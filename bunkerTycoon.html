  <h1>Bunker Tycoon & BT:R</h1>
  <h2>Bunker Tycoon (Original)</h2>
  <p>Bunker Tycoon is a popular roblox game made by <a href="https://rblx.trade/u/Doge_King4321"; title="View @MilitaryMech(Doge_king4321) on RblxTrade">MilitaryMech(@Doge_king4321)</a>.
   At the time of making this (01/01/2024), it has 2,300,213 visits, 4,485 Likes, 6,102 dislikes and 17,776 favourites.
   The game supports voice chat but has no facial animation.
   The game is in R6 and attempts to be as immersive as possible.</p>
   <p style="font-family:Arial Bold, sans-serif">The Doge_king4321 account was created on 11/18/2019 (MM/DD/YYYY) then banned on 8/1/2022 (MM/DD/YYYY) 1:22:22 PM (CT)
   Despite this, Most of the account's data is still accessable using RoGold's banned user search. (Not sponsored just really good.)
   1 More interesting thing to note is that I still have the original files for the original Bunker Tycoon and plan to make a classic version fixing all of the major bugs.

  <h2>Bunker Tycoon: Rebooted (BT:R)</h2>
  <p>Bunker Tycoon: Rebooted is a rebuilt version of Bunker Tycoon made by <a href="https://www.roblox.com/users/3767316216/profile">MrMilitaryMech (@mrmilitarymech)</a>.
   The game was built from the ground up with new code, models and a new desert map.
   Even though I'm the one writing this, I'm still unsure of the future of BT:R.
   The MrMilitaryMech account was created on 8/2/2022 (MM/DD/YYYY) and is yet to be banned (Sounds worse than it is).
